# Ubuntu Dev-Container Images — Reproducible DevOps Toolchain

A layered set of Ubuntu-based development-environment Docker images. A common
**base** image ships a broad cloud-native / DevOps toolchain (kubectl, helm,
kustomize, k9s, kind, flux, conftest, opa, Docker-in-Docker, …); the **java**
and **go** variants build on it with their respective language stacks. Every
tool version is pinned and reproducible via **mise** — see [TOOLING.md](./TOOLING.md).

Images are hadolint-linted, Trivy-scanned (filesystem + image), cosign
keyless-signed with SBOM attestation, and published to GHCR through a
Renovate-managed GitHub Actions pipeline.

## Image hierarchy

```text
ubuntu:26.04 (LTS)
  └─ docker-ubuntu-base   base + DevOps toolchain (mise-managed) + Docker-in-Docker
       ├─ docker-ubuntu-java   + Java 25 LTS / Maven / Gradle
       └─ docker-ubuntu-go     + Go toolchain & dev CLIs, kubebuilder, goreleaser,
                                 GPG, PostgreSQL
```

The `java` and `go` images are built `FROM ghcr.io/andriykalashnykov/docker-ubuntu-base`,
so `make build-java` / `make build-go` depend on `make build-base`.

## Tooling & versions

All CLI tools are managed by **[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev)** and pinned in
per-image `.mise.toml` files (`base/.mise.toml`, `java/.mise.toml`,
`go/.mise.toml`); the base OS (tag + digest) and mise itself are pinned via
Dockerfile `ARG`s. Everything is kept current automatically by Renovate.
The full strategy and the list of what is/ isn't mise-managed is documented in
**[TOOLING.md](./TOOLING.md)**.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with BuildKit | `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` |
| GNU Make | drives all build/run/push targets |
| `GITHUB_PAT` (write:packages) | only for `make login` / `push-*` to GHCR |

**All three images build with no host secrets** — the filesystem is credential-free.
For the **go** image, the operator's credentials are injected **at container start**
by `make run-go` (never baked into the image): an SSH key pair at
`~/.ssh/id_rsa{,.pub}` or `~/.ssh/id_ed25519{,.pub}`, a GPG secret key + ownertrust
at `$GPG_SECRET_KEY_FILE` / `$GPG_OWNERTRUST_FILE`, and the `GITHUB_PAT` /
`GPG_PASSPHRASE` env vars — each used only if present (otherwise a fresh SSH key is
generated and GPG/PAT setup is skipped). The `GPG_*` defaults point at the owner's
dotfiles; set them to your own exported files (see the example below).

```bash
export GITHUB_PAT=<github-pat-with-write:packages>   # for `make login` / push to GHCR
```

## Quick start

### Build and run the images locally

```bash
make build-base && make run-base      # base image
make build-java && make run-java      # java dev image
make build-go   && make run-go        # go dev image
```

`run-*` drops you into an interactive `bash` shell with the full toolchain on
`PATH` (and `JAVA_HOME` / `GOROOT` set by the entrypoint). `run-go` additionally
bind-mounts the host Docker socket (Docker-out-of-Docker) and the current directory,
and injects your SSH/GPG keys + PAT at container start (if present on the host).

### Go dev container with your SSH / GPG / GitHub credentials

The **go** image is credential-free; `make run-go` injects your credentials **at
container start** via read-only bind-mounts and env-by-name — no secret value ever
touches `docker`'s argv, and nothing is baked into the image. Provide whichever you
need; each is optional and used only if present:

```bash
# SSH key — auto-detected from ~/.ssh/id_rsa{,.pub} or ~/.ssh/id_ed25519{,.pub}
#   (read-only bind-mount; if absent, a fresh per-container key is generated)

# GitHub PAT — written to ~/.netrc inside the container for git-over-HTTPS auth.
#   Passed by env NAME only (the value never appears in argv).
export GITHUB_PAT=<github-pat-with-write:packages>

# GPG signing key — point these at YOUR exported secret key + ownertrust files
#   (read-only bind-mounts); the passphrase is passed by env NAME only.
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor KEYID > ~/gpg-secret.key
gpg --export-ownertrust                > ~/gpg-ownertrust.txt
export GPG_SECRET_KEY_FILE=~/gpg-secret.key
export GPG_OWNERTRUST_FILE=~/gpg-ownertrust.txt
export GPG_PASSPHRASE=<your-gpg-key-passphrase>

make build-go && make run-go                 # build (credential-free), then run with creds injected
```

Inside the container your SSH key is at `~/.ssh/`, your PAT is in `~/.netrc` (mode
`0600`), and your GPG key is imported into `~/.gnupg` — ready for `git clone` over
HTTPS and signed `git commit -S`.

> **Never** pass these as `docker build --build-arg` / values on the command line —
> that bakes the secret into the image history and exposes it via `ps` / `docker history`.
> The runtime-injection flow above is the only supported path.

### Run a published image (no build needed)

The `base` and `java` images are published to GHCR — pull and run directly:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/andriykalashnykov/docker-ubuntu-base:26.04 bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/andriykalashnykov/docker-ubuntu-java:26.04 bash
```

### Build a Java or Go app inside the container

Mount your project and run the toolchain. The entrypoint activates mise, so
`java`/`mvn`/`gradle`/`go` and `JAVA_HOME`/`GOROOT` are ready:

```bash
# Java (image ships Java 25 LTS, Maven 3.9, Gradle 9)
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/home/user/app -w /home/user/app \
  ghcr.io/andriykalashnykov/docker-ubuntu-java:26.04 mvn -B package
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/home/user/app -w /home/user/app \
  ghcr.io/andriykalashnykov/docker-ubuntu-java:26.04 gradle build

# Go (image ships Go 1.26 + dlv, goreleaser, swag, goose, …) — build go locally first
make build-go
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/home/user/app -w /home/user/app \
  ghcr.io/andriykalashnykov/docker-ubuntu-go:26.04 go build ./...
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/home/user/app -w /home/user/app \
  ghcr.io/andriykalashnykov/docker-ubuntu-go:26.04 go test ./...

# …or open an interactive shell with your project mounted and work normally:
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/home/user/app -w /home/user/app \
  ghcr.io/andriykalashnykov/docker-ubuntu-java:26.04 bash
```

> The **go** image is built locally only (`make build-go`) — a personal dev container
> that is local-only by policy (the image itself is credential-free; SSH/GPG/PAT are
> injected at run time), so build it before running it.

| `build-java` / `run-java` / `push-java` / `delete-java` | Java image lifecycle |
| `build-go` / `run-go` / `delete-go` | Go image lifecycle (built locally only) |
| `push-go` | Push go image — **blocked unless `ALLOW_GO_PUSH=1`** (local-only by policy; the image is credential-free) |
| `build-base-inline-cache` / `build-java-inline-cache` | Build & push the registry inline cache |
| `build-all` | Build base + go + java |
| `build-push-all` | Build & push the **publishable** images (base + java; go excluded) |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GITHUB_PAT` | GHCR auth (write:packages) for `login`/`push-*`; also injected into the **go** image `.netrc` at run time |
| `GPG_PASSPHRASE` | GPG key passphrase for the **go** image (passed to `make run-go` at run time) |
| `GPG_SECRET_KEY_FILE` | Path to your exported GPG **secret key** for the **go** image (`gpg --export-secret-keys`); default is the owner's dotfiles file |
| `GPG_OWNERTRUST_FILE` | Path to your exported GPG **ownertrust** for the **go** image (`gpg --export-ownertrust`); default is the owner's dotfiles file |
| `IMAGE_REGISTRY` | Override the publish registry (default `ghcr.io`) |

## CI/CD

- **`CI`** ([`main.yml`](./.github/workflows/main.yml)) — builds, scans, signs and
  publishes the **base + java** images to GHCR. Pipeline: `changes`
  (paths-filter) → `static-check` (hadolint + Trivy filesystem scan) → `build`
  (build → Trivy image scan → tag-gated push (`:26.04` + `:latest` + `:sha-…`) →
  cosign keyless signing by digest → SBOM generation) → `ci-pass` (single required
  status check). PRs build and scan but do not push/sign. The **go** image is
  built locally only (a personal dev container; local-only by policy).
- **Cleanup runs** ([`cleanup-runs.yml`](./.github/workflows/cleanup-runs.yml))
  — weekly prune of old workflow runs via the `gh` CLI.

Dependency updates are handled by **Renovate** (`renovate.json`): the Ubuntu base
tag (+ pinned digest), GitHub Action SHAs, the mise `ARG`, and every mise-pinned tool.

### Verify a published image signature

Images are signed keyless via cosign (Sigstore OIDC). Verify with:

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/andriykalashnykov/docker-ubuntu-base:26.04 \
  --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/AndriyKalashnykov/docker-ubuntu/.github/workflows/main.yml@refs/.*' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```
